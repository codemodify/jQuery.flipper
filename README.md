# jQuery.flipper
Implements flipping based on CSS animations.
Consider it one of the best on the net.
Here is the why:
* does not require adding any classes to you markup (including the ones like that are kind of over user everywhere like "front"/ "back")
* does not force you to bind to clicks or mouse-overs (which BTW many on the net implementation handle badly and have memory leaks coded in them)
* light-weight including because it only adds classes as needed once (no "-web-kit-" pollution if you run IE for example)
* don't blindly believe me, check the code first on the net then get back here and use this one
* I don't ask for beer or any .2 cents for some lines a of code that a 2nd grader can write even better than what you find on the net by "engineers".
* does not rely on the CSS's obvious and limiting "rotateY()"
